## Overview

[![ShieldMe Router Vpn][product-screenshot]](https://shield-me.net)

ShieldMe Router Vpn allows you to easily connect to VPN servers, manage favorite lists, check analytics and set custom VPN rules among many others – all of this directly from your Wi-Fi router.

My ultimate mission is to make VPN management easy for everyone by getting rid of the complexity behind this process and showing an intuitive user interface instead. To achieve this, my plan is to constantly develop, optimize and improve every aspect of ShieldMe through updates and by unlocking the full potential of your router.

I am committed to making sure you love using ShieldMe. If there is any way I can help, don’t hesitate to email me directly at help@shield-me.net.

As time goes by and the application grows, new and more interesting features will be added so keep an eye out for updates!

Even with 10+ years of experience in software development spanning many different tools and platforms/frameworks, mistakes are possible. For this reason, it would be extremely useful if you suggest changes or report bugs by opening an issue.

**A BIG THANK YOU!**

Thanks to your contributions, all of us reap the benefits of more stable and secure software.
